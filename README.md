## Requirements

### Project Goals
The aim of this project is to create a website dedicated to hosting information and reviews regarding energy drinks. Users can register to the website in order to post comments and upvotes/downvotes on specific drinks. Users will also have the ability to change any ratings and comments as well as delete them. Users do not have to be signed in to see the comments and ratings of drinks. Each drink will have a link to purchase the item online (an affiliate link).

### Project Features
The following are features that are essential to the project:

- Users have the ability to view basic information regarding energy drinks in a paginated format
- From the paginated list of drinks, users can click on a specific item to view an indepth look on that drink
- Each drink listed should have a page detailing information, a link to purchase, a comments section, upvote/downvote buttons and a general upvote/downvote score
- Users have the ability to create an account
- Users have the ability to log into a pre-existing account
- When logged into their account, users can post, update and remove comments on individual drinks
- When logged in, users can either upvote or downvote individual drinks
- When a user has a pre-existing upvote or downvote, users can change the vote and remove the vote

# CI Information

The code and the project management are split into two different repositories. Strange, I know. Initially I had started the project without Django, and started development using Flask and going that route. However, I realized the importance of using Django and decided to tidy everything up by moving the development to a fresh new repository. Yet another hurdle!
