### Project Goals
The aim of this project is to create a website dedicated to hosting information and reviews regarding energy drinks. Users can register to the website in order to post comments and upvotes/downvotes on specific drinks. Users will also have the ability to change any ratings and comments as well as delete them. Users do not have to be signed in to see the comments and ratings of drinks. Each drink will have a link to purchase the item online (an affiliate link).
